The capstone project I decdided to work on was a grocery list application. There are three main functions to the app, the enter, delete all, and meal ideas buttons. When the user inputs the grocery name item as well as the quantity, followed by clicking enter the item and its count will be dsiplayed. Which can be seen in "screenshot 2." Once the user has the item in their shopping cart they can cross it off their list by clicking the checkbox. After all shopping has been completed the delete all button will clear the entire list, allowing them to make a fresh list for the next time they go gorcery shopping. The meal ideas button randomly generate different meals to the user each time the button is clicked. Giving them so fresh new ideas for lunch or dinner. The quote doubles as a link to a recipe website so they cna figure out how to make the new dish. The technoliges used to make the app dynamic was javascript as well as express. Using get, post, and delete HTTP request methods.
